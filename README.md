# My DEPT Assignment

First off, I had a lot of fun making this assignment.\
I'm quite proud of what I managed to achieve within the given time. 

The assignment is build using React. The reason being that I really like developing in React, and I'm more familiar with it.\
Right from the start it was clear to me what kind of components I wanted to make. 

I'm especially proud of the Mobile layout. This is because I never really designed anything for mobile yet.\
That is probably why you'll see the styling be made desktop first, mobile afterwards. 

### Running this assignment 

To be able to run this assignment, you need an IDE in which you can run the scripts.\
You can use <strong>VS Code</strong>, or JetBrains' <strong>WebStorm</strong> (like I did).

First things first, you need to run `npm install` in the terminal, which will install all the required dependencies.

Then run `npm start` in the terminal. This will open the assignment on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\
(If port 3000 is already in use, React will ask you to open it on another port!)


Made in React v18.2.0
